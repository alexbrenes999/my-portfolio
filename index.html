            Hello visitors! My names is Alex and im currently attending the Coding bootcamp at UCF. I was born and raised in Costa Rica, until
            moving to the U.S. when i turned 10-years-old. Since I've been in the country, I've lived in states like Georgia, North Carolina, 
            New Jersey, Texas, and now Florida. I spent 6 of the last 10 years in Houston, Texas, which I now consider to be the place that feels closest
            to home. I actually plan to move back to Houston next summer! I enjoy the little things for the most part. For example, a great night to 
            me is driving around with friends, listening to music, windows down, eat out, have deep convesations, and generally enjoy eachother's
            company. I've never been one for going to the club or bars.
        </p>
        <p class="abtme2">
            For the last 2 years I've developed a love for computers. I've learned all about computers and their hardware. I've helped a handful of
            friends and family members building their PCs and this year I finally built mine! I waited a while because I wanted to make sure that
            I built a PC that has some solid specs. My build consists of an Intel i5 11400, RTX 3060, B560 Torpedo Motherboard, 16GB of RAM, and
            1.5TBs of storage! This eventually sparked my interest in looking into the software side of computers, thus bringing me to this bootcamp.
